+configurableLNBshare Revision History
+
+Version for VDR 1.4.3 
+
+- configurableLNBshare-VDR_1.4.3.patch from Matthias LÃ¶tzke (http://lÃ¶tzke.de/vdr.html)
+
+2010-04-10: Version for VDR 1.7.14
+- Created HISTORY.LNBshare
+- Created README.LNBshare
+- Fixed possible buffer overflow in cMenuSetupLNB::Setup(void)
+- Ignore all non-DVB-S devices when checking for possible conflicts.
+- Use the 'actual' device instead of the 'primary' device as device that is used as reciever for live viewing. This adds support for 'other' output devices than a FF card like xine. Based on a patch from CR7 at vdr-portal.de
+- Adept to  VDR 1.7.14. Support the new diseqc feature introduced with VDR 1.7.13: 'Added device definitions to the diseqc.conf file format, so that certain satellite positions can be limited to a given list of devices'.
+  
+2010-11-13:
+- Fix: Devices sharing same LNB don't switch channel on main channel switch (thanks to hivdr @ vdr-portal.de for reporting the bug and spockele @ vdr-portal.de and hopsi @ vdr-portal.de for testing the correction)
+- Fix: In LOG, device numbering is now as in VDR: Starting from 1, ...
+- Fix: Encoding of german umlaut in "DVB-EmpfÃ¤nger %d nutzt LNB Nr"
+
+2010-11-28:
+- Fix: Device numbering in message 'LNB or DiSEq conflict with device ...'.
+- Fix: Numbering of LNBs not using SAT
+
+2010-12-25: Version 0.1.0 for VDR version 1.7.16
+- Rename the patch to include patch version number (vdr-lnb-sharing-0.1.0-1.7.16.patch)
+- Write patch version number to log file (if logging is switched on).
+- Adept to  VDR 1.7.16
+
+2011-02-06 Version 0.1.1 for VDR version 1.7.16
+- Fix: If several DVB devices share one LNB, only the first of these devises will send signals like 22kHz. See README.LNBshare for details.
+  Thanks to Uwe (Licherkette @ vdr-portal.de) for finding and analyzing the error and testing the correction.
+- README.LNBshare: Include warning about 1.3 FF cards with buggy Loop-Through that might result in destruction of LNBP-Chips if the Loop-Through is used
+- Fix: Log file: Numbering of 'LNBs' not connected to a SAT DVB card
+
+2011-02-08 Version 0.1.2 for VDR version 1.7.16
+- Change: Make it easier to apply this patch together with the dynamite-Plugin patch. Note: this is mostly for maintainers of distributions and multi-patches. It will (must probably) not be possible for devices added with dynamite to share LNBs. Some concept work is required for this: How can VDR uniquely identify a device? How can a user identify such a device on OSD?
+
+2011-02-16 Version 0.1.3 for VDR version 1.7.16
+- Fix an error that can occur if devices are explizitly specified (-D or --device) during start of VDR. Thanks to Lars (mini73 @ vdr-portal.de) for reporting this error.
+
+2011-02-18 Version 0.1.4 for VDR version 1.7.16
+- Fix: Short before a recording starts, the system switches between black screen and channel. If VPS is used, the recording will not even start. Thanks to urknall @ vdr-portal.de for reporting this error and Uwe (Licherkette @ vdr-portal.de) for providing a Log

+Warning
+- At some 1.3 FF-Cards a voltage at the Loop-Through will destroy the LNBP-Chips of these cards. Please check the manual. If you are unsure or your card is affected, don't use the Loop-Through! Even if this patch avoids switching on the voltage in such a case, the patch might be buggy or wrong configured or ...
+
+Required hardware:
+- sat splitter like SVE 2-01 (reichelt.de). Make sure to have a sat splitter with built in diodes preventing any current in case of different voltage on the connected DVB cards.
+
+Settings (OSD)
+In VDR, if you select Settings -> LNB and have two or more devices that can recieve SAT channels, you can set the 'LNB Nr.' for each of these devices. Note:
+- All devices with an identical 'LNB Nr.' share the same LNB
+- The patch assumes that a device has always the same number. If you have more than two devices, you must make sure to load the drivers in a given order to make sure that each of the listed devices belongs always to the same card. If during setup, for example, your first DVB-S card is device 2 and your second DVB-S card is device 4 (device 1 and 3 are, for example, DVB-T cards) you must make sure that after reboot these stay the same: your first DVB-S card is device 2 and your second DVB-S card is device 4.
+- Signals (like DiSEqC, 22kHz, Voltage) are only sent by the first device if several devices share the same LNB. VDR will even switch on the LNB Voltage only on the first device. Note: This is not guarantied: If you use a Loop-Through, please see the warning in the README and make sure that the FF Card is the first card.
+
+DiSEqC Support:
+DiSEqC is supported, including the feature added in VDR 1.7.13: Added device definitions to the diseqc.conf file format, so that certain satellite positions can be limited to a given list of devices
+Note: Please ensure in diseqc.conf that all devices sharing one LNB have exactly the same satellite positions. The system will not check this, but, otherwise, the patch will not work correctly. This is not a restriction: obviously, if two devices share the same LNB, they can also receive the same satellite positions.
+
+Primary limit (Setup.PrimaryLimit):
+See MANUAL for a description: 'This is mainly useful for recordings that should take place only when there is nothing else to do, but should never keep the user from viewing stuff on the primary interface'
+In unpatched VDR, this seems to work with FF cards. For other output devices (for example vdr-xine), it probably won't work.
+Not fully supported by LNB sharing: If the primary device shares an LNB with device2, device2 might start a recording with priority < Setup.PrimaryLimit and force the primary device to an other channel.
+
+TODO / Missing:
+Intelligent assigning of timers to devices.
+Example: If you have 3 DVB-S cards and 2 of them share the same LNB, you can, in principle, record 2 channels in 'high' band and one in 'low' band. But, with this patch, this is not guaranteed. The DVB-S card with an own LNB might record one of the channels in high band. So, one of the other channels will not be recorded.
+Note:
+- Such intelligent scheduling is generally missing in VDR and would be also useful for 'mixed' systems with DVB-S and DVB-T cards as well as systems in which not all DVB-S cards can receive the same satellites.
+- I don't plan to implement this feature. Any volunteers?

+Hompage: http://projects.vdr-developer.org/projects/patch-lnbsharing . Please use this for bug reports. You can also create a new thread in http://www.vdr-portal.de , Developer->Patches for any questions.
+Git: The patch is available in http://projects.vdr-developer.org/git/?p=vdr-patch-lnbsharing.git
+
+License: The same license as for VDR applies. See file COPYING (in VDR sources) for details.
