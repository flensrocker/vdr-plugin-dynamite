VDR Plugin 'dynamite' Revision History
--------------------------------------

2011-01-06: Version 0.0.1

- Initial revision.

(developing and releasing were fast the last days
 so skipping some meaningless changes...)

2011-01-08: Version 0.0.4a

- rework patch for vdr so it won't collide with other patches
- LSTD outputs an asterisk behind the number of the primary device
- the number corresponds to the index in the array so it won't
  change for one device if others are attached/detached.
- DETD called with a number tries to detach the device at the
  given position in the array.

2011-01-09: Version 0.0.4b

- protect device array with a mutex
- add Service Interface "dynamite-AttachDevice-v0.1" and
  "dynamite-DetachDevice-v0.1"
  the pointer passed in "Data" is interpreted as a devpath like
  the SVDRP command ATTD and DETD.
  Returns always "true" on these commands even if Data is NULL
  as suggested in the docs.
- don't detach device which are receiving something with a
  priority > 0.

2011-01-09: Version 0.0.4c

- add new commands for locking/unlocking devices so the can
  be protected from accidently detaching (LCKD / UNLD)
- extend the Service interface with these commands
  "dynamite-LockDevice-v0.1" / "dynamite-UnlockDevice-v0.1"

2011-01-11: Version 0.0.4e

- add new command SCND

2011-01-11: Version 0.0.4i

- now it seems to work... :-)

2011-01-27: Version 0.0.4j

- add "GetTS" watchdog
- detach player and transfer mode on detach so all handles are freed

2011-01-27: Version 0.0.5

- add udev monitor for auto attaching new dvb-frontends
- you can use "dynamite --log-udev" on the vdr commandline for logging
  lots of udev events

2011-01-27: Version 0.0.5a

- refactor udev wrapper

2011-01-29: Version 0.0.5b

- add new command "SDGT" for setting a default "GetTS"-timeout for all attached
  and "to be attached" devices
- add "dynamite.DefaultGetTSTimeout" to setup.conf
- speed up dvb-device creation
- add alternate (more readable) commands for SVDRP like "AttachDevice" for "ATTD"

2011-01-30: Version 0.0.5c

- correct LDFLAGS in Makefile

2011-02-02: Version 0.0.5d

- add generic udev-filter for other plugins

2011-02-03: Version 0.0.5e

- rework vdr-patch to avoid problems with EITScanner (no ABI changes)

2011-02-10: Version 0.0.5f

- add new command to cDynamicDeviceProbe to call dynamite-Service (no ABI changes)
- extend udev-monitor with parsing of a timeout-value set by some udev rule

2011-02-16: Version 0.0.5g

- modify vdr-patch because zapping could interrupt recordings

2011-02-17: Version 0.0.5h

- add parsing of udev-property "dynamite_timeout_handler_arg"
- add "dynamite.GetTSTimeoutHandler = /path/to/program" to setup.conf
- call external program on GetTS-timeout

2011-02-17: Version 0.0.5i

- add idle option to cDevice, "idle"-devices must close all their handles.
  They are ignored by the epg-scan.

2011-02-23: Version 0.0.5j

- move reading of udev properties from the monitor to the attacher,
  so that they are recognized on devices present at startup.

2011-02-26: Version 0.0.5k

- while in cDvbDeviceProbe create only as much cDynamicDevice-objects as needed
- create dummy-device-probe only if specified on command line option "--dummy-probe"
- add commandline arg --GetTSTimeoutHandler /path/to/program
- add new command "DTAD" for detaching all devices

2011-03-09: Version 0.0.5l

- bugfix on logging error message

2011-03-17: Version 0.0.5m

- use getopt_long on commandline argument processing, look at README for new arguments
- raise event via cPlugin::Service if a device is attached/detached so other plugins
  can react on it ("dynamite-event-DeviceAttached-v0.1", "dynamite-event-DeviceDetached-v0.1")

2011-03-18: Version 0.0.5n

- add new command "ForceDetachDevice", the device will be detached regardless of any receivers
  or locks

2011-03-23: Version 0.0.5o

- fix bug in GetAudioChannelDevice (endless loop)

2011-03-24: Version 0.0.6

- scan with udev for dvb devices on startup to bridge gaps in the adapter numbers
- add udev property "dynamite_attach" to keep devices from being attached
- add udev property "dynamite_instanceid" to associate the devices to different vdr instances

2011-03-25: Version 0.0.6a

- add some OSD functionality

2011-04-06: Version 0.0.6c

- add new parameter "--free-device-slots" and leave an additional slot free
  if streamdev-client is loaded

2011-06-15: Version 0.0.6d

- add udev property "dynamite_cardindex" to attach a device at a preferred slot (if free)

2011-06-22: Version 0.0.6e

- leave eight additional slots free if mcli-plugin is loaded

2011-07-03: Version 0.0.6f

  and as parameter "dynamite.IdleHook = /path/to/program" at setup.conf

2011-08-17: Version 0.0.6h

- add patch for vdr 1.7.19 and add support for new virtual methods of cDevice

2011-09-04: Version 0.0.7a

  --idle-timout=m  set unused devices after m minutes to idle
  --idle-wakeup=h  waheup idle devices after h hours
